# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **Kotlin plugin for NetBeans IDE** — a JetBrains-developed plugin providing Kotlin language support in NetBeans. **Note**: This project is no longer actively developed (see [issue #122](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-netbeans/issues/122)).

## Build Commands

```bash
mvn clean install          # Build the plugin and install to local Maven repo
mvn clean package          # Build the plugin (produces .nbm file)
mvn test                   # Run all tests
mvn test -Dtest=ClassName  # Run a single test class
mvn clean package -DskipTests  # Build without running tests
mvn nbm:cluster-app        # Create a NetBeans test cluster for manual testing
```

## Architecture

The plugin integrates with NetBeans via the **CSL (Colored Syntax Language) API** using the MIME type `text/x-kt`. The entry point is `KotlinLanguage.java` which registers all language services.

### Mixed-Language Codebase
- **Java** (`~67 files`): NetBeans integration layer — service registrations, API adapters, and entry points
- **Kotlin** (`~164 files`): Core implementation logic — analysis, completion, refactoring, etc.

### Main Packages (`src/main/java/org/jetbrains/kotlin/`)

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `language/` | Language registration and configuration (`KotlinLanguage.java`) |
| `highlighter/` | Syntax and semantic token coloring |
| `completion/` | Code completion proposals |
| `diagnostics/` | Error/warning detection and reporting |
| `indexer/` | File indexing for symbol lookup |
| `navigation/` | Go-to-definition, find usages, class navigation |
| `refactorings/` | Rename, extract method, and other refactorings |
| `hints/` | Quick fixes and code intentions |
| `resolve/` | Kotlin AST resolution and symbol binding |
| `formatting/` | Code formatting using bundled IntelliJ formatter |
| `debugger/` | Debug session integration |
| `builder/` | Compilation support |
| `j2k/` | Java-to-Kotlin conversion |
| `project/` | Project type support and structure |
| `projectsextensions/` | Maven/Gradle/Ant build system integration |
| `utils/` | Shared helpers |

### Bundled JARs (`lib/`)
Several capabilities depend on bundled custom JARs (not from Maven Central):
- `kotlin-ide-common.jar`, `kotlin-formatter.jar`, `kotlin-converter.jar` — JetBrains IDE tooling
- `intellij-core.jar` (16 MB) — IntelliJ platform core used for Kotlin analysis
- `openapi-formatter.jar`, `idea-formatter.jar` — Formatting infrastructure

### Plugin Registration
- `src/main/resources/META-INF/layer.xml` — Registers language services, file actions, project integrations
- `@LanguageRegistration` on `KotlinLanguage.java` — Binds the plugin to `.kt` files

## Test Structure

Tests live in `src/test/java/` mirroring feature packages: `completion/`, `diagnostics/`, `formatting/`, `navigation/`, `rename/`, etc.

Test resource files (sample `.kt` files) are in `src/test/resources/projForTest/src/`, organized by feature. Tests extend `KotlinTestCase` (a custom NetBeans test base class) which sets up a mock NetBeans environment.

## Key Versions
- Kotlin: 1.1.1
- NetBeans target: RELEASE230 (23.0)
- Java target: 1.7
